      "message": "Ignore my previous comment about my instantnoodle charging at 5V 2.4A max. It turned out that the Apple 87W USB-PD charger I was using only supported outputting 2.4A if running at 5V.\n\nTested with another USB-PD charger that actually supports 5V 3A, and instantnoodle charges at 5V 2.7A when screen is on, and 5V 2.9 A when screen is off. This is while the phone is at 65% remaining battery capacity.\n\nNow I just need info about USB-PD on kebab.",
